This facility parallels that of the 
<A HREF="SystemLibrary.html#System_Library">System Library (SLIB</A>) 
and enables
members of a team to create a library into which they may export a
(sub) development, and from which they may 
<A HREF="Structuring.html#IMPORTS_Clause!Using">import</A> 
a development.

<H2>Making a New Project Team Library</H2>
<OL>
  <LI> Create an empty directory (with appropriate name)
     (e.g. some-path/BTeamLib); all team members must have
     read/write permission to the directory.

 <LI> Make the directory into a B development directory by
     invoking the B-Toolkit from within the new directory.
     Leave the development empty.

 <LI> The team member who will be working on sub-developments
     within the team must set the 
     <A HREF="Options.html#Options!Teamlib">Teamlib</A>
     value of the <A HREF="Options.html#Options">Options</A>, e.g.  
</OL>
The team library is now ready for use.

<H2>Exporting Developments to the Team Library:</H2>

This facility is available under Utilities, enabling a user to export
a completed (sub) development from their directory to that of the
current team library;
<A HREF="Options.html#Options!Teamlib">Teamlib</A>
must be set.
<P>
A completed development is a single 
<A HREF="AMNotation.html#MACHINE">MACHINE</A> 
for which an
<A HREF="AMNotation.html#IMPLEMENTATION">IMPLEMENTATION</A> 
is written and a binary code module exists (see 
<A HREF="Translator.html#Translator">Translator</A> 
for getting binary code modules from IMPLEMENTATIONS).
<P>
A warning will be given if the MACHINE 
<A HREF="Structuring.html#SEES_Clause!Using">SEES</A> 
other MACHINES. This can
be ignored unless the intention is that the seen machine should be a
non-sharable module private to the exported sub-development, in which
case the seen module should be 
<A HREF="Structuring.html#IMPORTS_Clause!Using">IMPORTED</A> 
into the sub-development that
is being exported.
<P>
Exported developments appear as library machines within the team
library. The library machines can be used directly within the team
library or can be committed into other B developments within the same
team.

<H2>Committing Developments from the Team Library:</H2>

TLIB constructs may be introduced to a development through
<A HREF="Introduce.html#Introduce">Introduce</A>. If a TLIB construct
<A HREF="Structuring.html#SEES_Clause!Using">SEES</A> 
other MACHINES, a warning will be issued that these constructs should
subsequently be introduced into the importing environment.

<P>
Each committed TLIB
MACHINE is, of course,
<A HREF="Animator.html">animatable</A>.
