<A NAME="Analyser"></A>
<H1>
The Analyser (anl)</H1>
Analysis is the first stage of processing necessary for a <A HREF="AMNotation.html#MACHINE">MACHINE</A>,
<A HREF="AMNotation.html#REFINEMENT">REFINEMENT</A> or <A HREF="AMNotation.html#IMPLEMENTATION">IMPLEMENTATION</A>
and is a prerequisite for the application of the <A HREF="POGenerator.html#Proof_Obligation!Generator">POGenerator
(pog)</A> -- and hence the <A HREF="AutoProver.html#AutoProver">Provers</A>,
the <A HREF="Animator.html#Animator">Animator (anm)</A> and <A HREF="DocumentMarkUp.html#Document_Mark_Up">Documentation
Tool (dmu)</A>.

<P>The <A HREF="POGenerator.html#Proof_Obligation!Generator">POGenerator</A>
automatically invokes the Analyser for a construct which has not been analysed.
Thus for a newly-introduced MACHINE, REFINEMENT or IMPLEMENTATION only
the Editor, Analyser and POGenerator options are available.

<P>The Analyser (anl) is invoked from the <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Environments!Main">Main
Environment</A>, and is applicable to all specifications, refinements and
implementations not currently analysed.

<P>Analysis comprises three distinct phases: normalisation, syntax-checking
and type-checking. The&nbsp;<A NAME="Normaliser"></A>Normaliser produces
an internal form -- <A NAME="Analysed_Form"></A>the analysed form
-- for the construct, expanding subordinate constructs where necessary.
The SyntaxChecker performs syntactic checks on the construct, and the TypeChecker
performs checks for type correctness.

<P>If the Analyser succeeds, an internal form of the construct is created
and stored in the directory ANL, and a summary of the type information
(in internal form) is placed in a ``<A NAME="Type_File"></A>Type File''
in the TYP directory, for use by the other tools.

<P>The dependencies between parent and subordinate constructs are built
up and recorded by the Analyser. Any record of such a dependency will be
removed when the parent or one of its subordinates has been edited such
that the mathematical content is changed, and the change committed (by
one of the <A HREF="Commit.html#Commit">Commit</A>, <A HREF="Close.html#Close">Close</A>
or <A HREF="Remake.html#Remake">Remake</A> tools); the parent's analysed
form (and all subsequent processing on the construct) will also be lost
(although it may be automatically reconstructed using the Remake tool).

<P>If an error is detected during analysis then the <A HREF="MiniRemake.html#MiniRemake">MiniRemake</A>
option is offered.

<P>A by-product of Analysis is the creation of a <A HREF="Hypertext.html">hypertext
file</A> for the analysed construct, containing links to all subordinate
constructs.
<H2>
Edited Files</H2>
If the Analyser is requested for a construct which is being currently <A HREF="Editor.html#Editor">edited</A>,
and the edited version (i.e. that version in the <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Development_Environment">SRC</A>
directory) differs from that of the committed version (in the system CFG
directory), three options are offered:
<UL>
<LI>
Proceed after committing</LI>

<LI>
Proceed without committing</LI>

<LI>
Show Difference (between the SRC and CFG files)</LI>
</UL>
Accepting the commit option will have the same effect as that described
for the <A HREF="Commit.html#Commit">Commit</A> tool.

<H2>Subordinate Constructs</H2>The <A HREF="Analyser.html#Normaliser">Normaliser</A>
will need to access the analysed form for all constructs subordinate to
that which is being currently analysed. (A construct `A' is dependent on
a construct `B' if `A' <A HREF="Structuring.html#SEES_Clause!Using">SEES</A>,
<A HREF="Structuring.html#USES_Clause!Using">USES</A>, <A HREF="Structuring.html#INCLUDES_Clause!Using">INCLUDES</A>,
<A HREF="Structuring.html#IMPORTS_Clause!Using">IMPORTS</A> or <A HREF="Structuring.html#REFINES_Clause">REFINES</A>
`B.' Conversely, `B' is said to be a subordinate construct of `A'.)

<P>If a subordinate construct is configured but not currently analysed,
the subordinate construct will first be analysed; this process is recursive.

<P>If a subordinate construct is not configured, the Normaliser will search
first in the <A HREF="SystemLibrary.html#System_Library">SLIB</A> directory
(taking account of any `dot rename' prefixes), and then the <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Development_Environment">SRC</A>
directory; if found, it will first be introduced and then analysed.

<P>If the above search is not successful, the Normaliser will check to
see whether the subconstruct is generated from an <A HREF="Enumerator.html#Enumerator">ENUMERATION</A>;
if the appropriate enumeration is configured, it will be generated. If
the enumeration is not configured but exists in the <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Development_Environment">SRC</A>
directory, it is first committed and the the machine generated.
<H2>
Type Determination</H2>
Each variable (a state variable, a constant, a quantified variable in a
predicate or a local variable within an operation) is given a type by the <A NAME="TypeChecker">TypeChecker</A>,
i.e. the tool determines to which set within a pool of sets the variable belongs.
The pool of sets consists of the sets given in the <A HREF="AMNotation.html#SETS_Clause">SETS</A>
clause and in the formal parameter list, together with all other sets which
can be constructed from the given sets by means of the power set operation
(<A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Sets!Power">POW</A>) and the Cartesian product
operation (<A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Cartesian_Product">*</A>).

<P>For example:

<P>if <TT>cc</TT> is a constant and if <TT>CSET</TT> is a given set and
the <A HREF="AMNotation.html#PROPERTIES_Clause">PROPERTIES</A> clause contains
<OL>
<LI>
<TT>cc &lt;: CSET</TT>

<P>then <TT>cc</TT> is given type <TT>POW(CSET)</TT></P>
</LI>
<LI>
<TT>cc = 7</TT>

<P>then <TT>cc</TT> is given type <TT>NAT</TT></P>
</LI>
<LI>
<TT>cc : NAT --> CSET</TT>

<P>then <TT>cc</TT> is given type <TT>POW(NAT*CSET)</TT></P>
</LI>
</OL>
if <TT>ASET</TT> is also given and <TT>aa</TT> and <TT>rel</TT> are variables
and the <A HREF="AMNotation.html#INVARIANT_Clause">INVARIANT</A> clause
contains
<OL>
<LI>
<TT>aa &lt;: ASET</TT>

<P>then <TT>aa</TT> is given type <TT>POW(ASET)</TT></P>
</LI>
<LI>
<TT>aa = cc</TT>

<P>then <TT>bb</TT> is given the same type as <TT>cc</TT></P>
</LI>
<LI>
<TT>rel : ASET &lt;-> CSET</TT>

<P>then <TT>rel</TT> is given type <TT>POW(ASET*CSET)</TT></P></LI>
</OL>
if <TT>bb</TT> is a local variable and <TT>bb := 1</TT> is the first statement
encountered by the TypeChecker then <TT>bb</TT> is given type <TT>NAT</TT>.

<P>An error is reported if a type of a variable cannot be determined.
<H2>
Type Checking</H2>
Given the type of all variables then all formulae in which they occur are
checked for type consistency (so in the expression <TT>aa=bb</TT>, <TT>aa</TT>
and <TT>bb</TT> must be of the same type). An error is reported if a formulae
does not type check, and an explanation is given.

<P>Often the error is due to an inconsistent use of externally defined
variables or operations. The <A HREF="Find.html#Find">Find</A> facility
will provide the type of those externally defined variables or operations.
