<H1><A NAME="B-Method">The B-Method</A></H1>
The B-Method is a collection of mathematically based techniques for the
specification, design and implementation of software components. Systems
are modelled as a collection of interdependent <A HREF="AMNotation.html#Abstract_Machines">Abstract
Machines</A>, for which an object-based approach is employed at all stages
of development.

<P>An Abstract Machine is described using the <A HREF="AMNotation.html#AMN">Abstract
Machine Notation (AMN)</A>. A uniform notation is used at all levels of
description, from specification, through design, to implementation.

<P>AMN is a state-based formal specification language in the same school
as VDM and Z. An <A HREF="AMNotation.html#Abstract_Machines">Abstract Machine</A>
comprises a state together with operations on that state. In a specification
and a design of an Abstract Machine the state is modelled using notions
like sets, relations, functions, sequences etc.. The operations are modelled
using Pre- and Post-conditions using AMN.

<P>In an implementation of an abstract machine the state is again modelled
using a set-theoretical model, but this time we already have an implementation
for the model. The operations are described using a pseudo-programming
notation that is a subset of AMN.

<P>The B-Method prescribes how to check the specification for consistency
(preservation of invariant) and how to check designs and implementations
for correctness (correctness of data refinement and correctness of algorithmic
refinement).

<P>The B-Method further prescribes how to structure large designs and large
developments, and promotes the re-use of specification models and software
modules, with object orientation central to specification construction
and implementation design.

<P>A great deal of attention has been paid to making the notational aspect
of the method as simple as possible. To the engineer, the formal notation
looks like a simple pseudo programming notation. And as mentioned above,
there is no real distinction between the specification notation and the
programming notation.

<P>The method and the notation have been designed together with the <A HREF="BToolkit.html#B-Toolkit">B-Toolkit</A>
that supports them, so that every aspect of the method has been validated
by the possibility of providing significant help to the engineer in using
computer based tools to write, verify and maintain software. Most theoretical
aspects of the method, such as formulation of proof obligations, are done
automatically by the tools. The provers are also designed to run automatically
and reference a large library of mathematical rules, provided with the
system.

<P>Separate (object based) techniques within the method support the design
of (large) specification construction and that of (large) program construction.
The complex dependencies within such big systems are automatically controlled
by the tools.
