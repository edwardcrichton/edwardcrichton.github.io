<H1><A NAME="B-Platform">The B-Platform</A></H1>
The B-Platform is the proof engine that underpins the <A HREF="BToolkit.html#B-Toolkit">B-Toolkit</A>,
many parts of which are implemented in the&nbsp;<A NAME="B-Theory_Language"></A>B-Theory
Language (B-TL) which the B-Platform supports.

<P>B-TL can be viewed as a kind of logic/functional programming language,
whose program statements, called <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Theory">``Theories''</A>
consist of ordered sets of inference rules. A natural-deduction-style proof
engine uses <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference!Backwards">backwards</A>
and <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference!Forwards">forwards</A> inference
to evaluate programs. <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference!Rewriting">Rewriting</A>
is treated as a special form of backwards inference.

<P>A <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Tactic">tactic language</A> is used to add
additional control to the inference mechanism.

<P>B-TL is also the language used to supply additional user theories to
the B-Toolkit's <A HREF="Animator.html#Users_Theory!in_Animator">Animator</A>
and <A HREF="InterProver.html#Users_Theory!InterProver">InterProver</A>.

<P>Although no explicit interface to the B-Platform is visible through
the B-Toolkit, experienced B-Toolkit users will need to have knowledge
of the syntax of B-TL and the proof mechanisms used in the B-Platform.

<P>The B-Platform is best viewed as a ``Proof Assistant'' in constructing
formal proofs. It is not a true ``Theorem Prover'', because inference rules
supplied by the user do not have to be proved in terms of some basic set
of axioms. The B-Platform just mechanises the application of rules, and
assists with some of the house-keeping.

<P>The B-Platform can be purchased separately from B-Core (UK) Ltd. in
their product called the B-Tool (rather than B-Toolkit). It is useful for
playing with and learning about proof, as well as for implementing advanced
tools such as provers; the B-Platform is also sometimes referred to as
the B-Kernel.

<P>For the purposes of B-Toolkit users, a limited knowledge the syntax
of a formula in B-TL is all that is required; other aspects of the language
are not relevant. What follows below is not intended to be a thorough description
of the B-Platform, or a complete syntax for B-TL, but rather a summary
of those aspects that are essential to a working knowledge for the B-Toolkit
user.

<H2>
Inference Rules</H2>
An&nbsp;<A NAME="Inference_Rules"></A>Inference Rule in <A HREF="BPlatform.html#B-Theory_Language">B-TL</A>
is a&nbsp;<A NAME="Formula"></A>Formula written broadly according to the
syntax of the <A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Mathematical_Notation">mathematical
notation</A> of <A HREF="AMNotation.html#AMN">AMN</A>. An important concept
is that of a ``Joker'', which is used in AMN only in the <A HREF="AMNotation.html#DEFINITIONS_Clause">DEFINITIONS
clause</A>.

<P>A&nbsp;<A NAME="Joker"></A>Joker can be any single upper or lower-case
letter. A Joker is true variable which can be replaced by any Formula.
It is to be distinguished from AMN variables, which appear as <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Identifier">identifiers</A>
in B-TL, which have to be at least two characters long.

<P>Identifiers can be modified by appending a <TT>Number</TT>. This is
to allow tools to create new variables when copying formulae. In the B-Toolkit,
it is used to distinguish between copies of the same state variable in
different contexts (inside and outside of a loop, for instance).

<P>Three major types of rules are distinguished, `` <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference_Rules!Simple">simple
rules</A>'', `` <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference_Rules!Rewrite">rewrite
rules</A>'' and `` <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference_Rules!Forward">forward
rules</A>'', which, despite being syntactically similar, are applied in
very different ways. Simple rules and rewrite rules are both used in backwards
inference, and so are grouped as ``<A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference_Rules!Backward">backward
rules</A>''.

<HR WIDTH="40%">
<H3>
Simple Rules</H3>
A <A NAME="Inference_Rules!Simple"></A>Simple Rule has the following
syntax:-
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="Simple_Rule"></A>Simple_Rule&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= Antecedents => Consequent&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequent

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="Antecedents"></A>Antecedents&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= Antecedents &amp; Formula&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Formula

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="Consequent"></A>Consequent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= Formula</PRE>
An example of a simple rule is:-
<PRE>    a <A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Sets!Inclusion">&lt;:</A> c &amp;
    b <A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Sets!Inclusion">&lt;:</A> c
   =>
    a <A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Sets!Union">\/</A> b <A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Sets!Inclusion">&lt;:</A> c</PRE>
This rule states, in effect, that a goal of the form
<PRE>    a \/ b &lt;: c</PRE>
can be proved if the two goals
<PRE>    a &lt;: b &amp;
    a &lt;: c</PRE>
can both be proved.

<P>In this example, <TT>a</TT>, <TT>b</TT> and <TT>c</TT> are Jokers which
stand for any formula. So applying this rule to the goal
<PRE>    STAFF \/ CUSTOMER &lt;: PERSON</PRE>
has the effect of applying the rule
<PRE>    STAFF &lt;: PERSON &amp;
    CUSTOMER &lt;: PERSON
   =>
   STAFF \/ CUSTOMER &lt;: PERSON</PRE>
Simple rules are used for&nbsp;<A NAME="Inference!Backwards"></A>Backwards
Inference. They are applied as follows:-
<OL>
<LI>
The <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Consequent">Consequent</A> is <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Pattern_Match">matched</A>
to the current goal by substituting a formula for each Joker which makes
the Consequent identical to the goal. If no such match can be found, the
rule cannot be applied.</LI>

<LI>
If the match is successful, the same substitution of formulae for Jokers
is applied to the <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Antecedents">Antecedents</A>
(if any).</LI>

<LI>
The current goal is replaced by a set of new goals which are the new Antecedents
(if any).</LI>
</OL>
Note that Simple Rules need not have <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Antecedents">Antecedents</A>,
in which case their application is said to ``discharge'' a goal: the goal
is replaced by an empty set of goals. For example:-
<PRE>    a : {a}</PRE>
could match and discharge the goal
<PRE>    percy : {percy}</PRE>

<HR WIDTH="40%">

<H3>
Rewrite Rules</H3>
A&nbsp;<A NAME="Inference_Rules!Rewrite"></A>Rewrite Rule has the following
syntax:-
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rewrite_Rule&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Antecedents">Antecedents</A> => Rewrite&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rewrite

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rewrite&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= Formula == Formula</PRE>
An example of a rewrite rule is:-
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not(s = {})&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; =>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; max({max(s),x}) == max(s\/{x})</PRE>
This rule states, in effect, that, if <TT>not(s = {})</TT> can be proved,
any sub-formula of the current goal that has the form <TT>max({max(s),x})</TT>
can be rewritten as <TT>max(s\/{x})</TT>.

<P>The Jokers <TT>s</TT> and <TT>x</TT> can be replaced by any formula,
so that applying this rule to the goal
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; max({max({0}),new}) == max({0}\/{new})</PRE>
has the effect of applying the rule
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not({0} = {})&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; =>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; max({max({0}),new}) == max({0}\/{new})</PRE>
<A NAME="Inference!Rewriting"></A>Rewrite rules are used for <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference!Backwards">Backwards
Inference</A>, and are applied as follows:-
<OL>
<LI>
The left-hand side of the <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference_Rules!Rewrite">Rewrite</A>
is <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Pattern_Match">matched</A> to any sub-formula
of the current goal by substituting a formula for each Joker which makes
the Consequent identical to the goal. If no such match can be found, the
rule cannot be applied.</LI>

<LI>
If the match is successful, the same substitution of formulae for Jokers
is applied to the right-hand side of the Rewrite, and to <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Antecedents">Antecedents</A>
(if any).</LI>

<LI>
The current goal is replaced by a set of goals which comprises:-

<UL>
<LI>
the new goal resulting from applying the Rewrite to the matched sub-formula
of the current goal; and</LI>

<LI>
the new Antecedents (if any).</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</OL>
Note that a Rewrite Rule need not have <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Antecedents">Antecedents</A>.

<HR WIDTH="40%">
<H3>
Forward Rules</H3>
A&nbsp;<A NAME="Inference_Rules!Forward"></A>Forward Rule has the following
syntax:-
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forward_Rule ::= <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Antecedents">Antecedents</A> => <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Consequent">Consequent</A></PRE>
An example of a Forward Rule is :-
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not(a:T) &amp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a:(S\/T)
&nbsp;&nbsp; =>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a:S</PRE>
This rule states, in effect, that, if it is known that <TT>not(a:T)</TT>
and that <TT>a:(S\/T)</TT>, then it is also known that <TT>a:S</TT>.

<P>The Jokers <TT>a</TT>, <TT>S</TT> and <TT>T</TT> can be replaced by
any formula, so that applying this rule to the hypotheses
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not(percy:STAFF) &amp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; percy:(CUSTOMER\/STAFF)</PRE>
has the effect of applying the rule
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not(percy:STAFF) &amp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; percy:(CUSTOMER\/STAFF)
&nbsp;&nbsp; =>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; percy:CUSTOMER</PRE>
Forward rules are used for&nbsp;<A NAME="Inference!Forwards"></A>Forwards
Inference, which is used every time a new hypothesis is introduced into
the set of <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Hypotheses!Current_set">hypotheses</A>.

<P>Forwards rules are applied as follows:-
<OL>
<LI>
The <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Antecedents">Antecedents</A> are <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Pattern_Match">matched</A>
to the current set of <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Hypotheses!Current_set">hypotheses</A>
by substituting a formula for each Joker which makes each Antecedent identical
to one of the hypotheses. If no complete match can be found, the rule cannot
be applied.</LI>

<LI>
If the match is successful, the same substitution of formulae for Jokers
is applied to the <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Consequent">Consequent</A>.</LI>

<LI>
The new consequent is added to the current set of <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Hypotheses!Current_set">hypotheses</A>.</LI>
</OL>
Note that a Forwards Rule must always have <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Antecedents">Antecedents</A>.

<HR WIDTH="40%">
<H3>
Backward Rules</H3>
<A NAME="Inference_Rules!Backward"></A>Backwards Rules are <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference_Rules!Simple">Simple
Rules</A> or <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference_Rules!Rewrite">Rewrite Rules</A>.&nbsp;<A NAME="Pattern_Match"></A>

<HR WIDTH="60%">
<H2>
Pattern Matching</H2>
The presence of <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Joker">jokers</A> in formulae allow
pattern matching to take place. A formula <TT>f</TT> matches a formula
<TT>g</TT> if a substitution <TT>S</TT> of formulae for the jokers of <TT>f</TT>
can be found such that <TT>[S]f</TT> is identical to <TT>g</TT>.

<P>For example, matching the formula
<PRE>    age(p) : T</PRE>
to the formula
<PRE>    age(percy) : 0..120</PRE>
is achieved using the substitution
<PRE>    p , T <A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Substitutions!Simultaneous">:=</A> percy , (0..120)</PRE>
Special care must be taken with the matching to comma-separated lists.
The comma operator is treated just like other left-associative infix operators.
So the formula <TT>{p}</TT> can match the formula <TT>{1,2,3}</TT> with
substitution
<PRE>    p := 1,2,3</PRE>
whereas <TT>{P,p}</TT> would match as
<PRE>    P , p := (1,2) , 3</PRE>

<HR WIDTH="60%">
<A NAME="Guards"></A>
<H2>
Guards</H2>
Guards are a special kind of <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Antecedents">Antecedent</A>
for backwards rules that are evaluated in a different way during proof
construction. The proof mechanism prevents rules from being applied if
the guards do not evaluate to true.

<P>Guards also provide a means of making inference rules more generic.
Their syntax is as follows:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guards&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= Guards &amp; Guard&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guard

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guard&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::= "binhyp" ( Formula )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "bnum" ( Formula )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "bident" ( Formula )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "bstring" ( Formula )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "btest" ( Number Comparison Number )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "bsearch" ( Formula , ( Formula_List ) , Formula ) |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "breade" ( Formula , Formula_List , Formula )

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comparison ::=&nbsp; &lt;&nbsp; |&nbsp; &lt;=&nbsp; |&nbsp; >&nbsp; |&nbsp; >=&nbsp; |&nbsp; =&nbsp; |&nbsp; /=</PRE>
In this context, a <TT>Number</TT> is any Natural number less than 2^32.
A <TT>Formula_List</TT> is comma (or in some cases ``<TT>&amp;</TT>'',
``<TT>or</TT>'' or ``<TT>;</TT>'') separated list of Formulae.

<P>A brief explanation of these guards is as follows:-
<DL>
<DT>
<A NAME="Guards!binhyp"></A><TT>binhyp(x)</TT></DT>

<DD>
&nbsp;succeeds if there is a hypothesis which matches <TT>x</TT>. For example,
application of the following simple rule

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; binhyp(f:S<A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Functions!Total">--></A>T) &amp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x:S
&nbsp;&nbsp; =>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f(x) : T</PRE>
to the formula
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; age(pers) : 0..120</PRE>
in the presence of the hypothesis
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; age:PERSON-->0..120</PRE>
behaves as if the following rule is applied:-
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; age:PERSON-->0..120 &amp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pers:PERSON
&nbsp;&nbsp; =>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; age(pers) : 0..120</PRE>
</DD>
<DT>
<A NAME="Guards!btest"></A><TT>btest( x > y )</TT></DT>

<DD>
succeeds if <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT> are valid <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Number">numbers</A>,
and <TT>x</TT> is greater than <TT>y</TT> (and similarly for the other
comparison operators). For example:-

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; btest(a/=b)
&nbsp;&nbsp; =>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not(a:{b})</PRE>
</DD>
<DT>
<A NAME="Guards!bsearch"></A><TT>bsearch(x,(l),r)</TT></DT>

<DD>
succeeds if the formula <TT>x</TT> matches a formula in the list
<TT>l</TT>, and <TT>r</TT> is the list <TT>l</TT> with the matched formula
removed. The list can be separated by commas, ``<TT>&amp;</TT>'' or ``<TT>or</TT>''.

<P>For example, a typical use of this guard is as follows:-
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bsearch((x &lt; y),P,Q) &amp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [x,y := 1,2]P
&nbsp;&nbsp; =>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #(x,y).P</PRE>
This rule can be used to attempt to prove an existential quantifier in
which <TT>P</TT> contains the constraint <TT>x &lt; y</TT> by selecting
specific values for <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT>, namely <TT>1</TT> and <TT>2</TT>.

<P>The antecedent <TT>[x,y := 1,2]P</TT> is a predicate identical to <TT>P</TT>
with all <A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Freeness">free occurrences</A> of
<TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT> replaced by <TT>1</TT> and <TT>2</TT> respectively.
So applying this rule to the goal
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #(a,b).( a:NAT &amp; b:NAT &amp; a &lt; b )</PRE>
has the same effect as applying the rule
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1:NAT &amp; 2:NAT &amp; 1 &lt; 2
&nbsp;&nbsp; =>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #(a,b).( a:NAT &amp; b:NAT &amp; a &lt; b )</PRE>
Careful attention is, of course, given to the renaming of variables to
ensure that clashes with <A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Freeness">free variables</A>
are avoided.
</DD>
<DT>
<A NAME="Guards!breade"></A><TT>breade(f,l,x)</TT></DT>

<DD>
&nbsp;displays the list of formulae <TT>l</TT> on the screen according
to the format given in the quoted string <TT>f</TT>, and succeeds if <TT>x</TT>
matches the response typed by the user.

<P>The format string <TT>f</TT> works on the same kind of principle as
<TT>printf</TT> function in C. The <TT>%</TT> character is used to mark
the position of formulas in the output, and various escape characters are
allowed, such as follows:-
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<TT>\n</TT> line feed</LI>

<LI>
<TT>\t</TT> tabulation</LI>

<LI>
<TT>\E</TT> escape</LI>

<LI>
<TT>\B</TT> bell</LI>

<LI>
<TT>\"</TT> double quote</LI>

<LI>
<TT>\\</TT> back slash</LI>

<LI>
<TT>\%</TT> percent</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
This guard can be used to assist in the selection of values in the proof
of existential quantification, or quite simply to trace the application
of user-defined rules.

<P>For example, another way of treating the existential quantification
above is by providing the rule:-
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breade("\n -- Choose values for %,% which satisfy % : ",x,y,P,(s,t)) &amp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [x,y <A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Substitutions!Simultaneous">:=</A> s,t]Q
&nbsp;&nbsp; =>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Quantification!Existential">#</A>(x,y).P</PRE>
Attempted application of this rule to the goal
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #(a,b).( a:NAT &amp; b:NAT &amp; a&lt;b )</PRE>
would result in the following message being displayed on the screen:-
<PRE>&nbsp;-- Choose values for a,b which satisfy (a:NAT &amp; b:NAT &amp; a&lt;b) :</PRE>
to which the user may respond by typing <TT>1,2</TT> for the same effect
of the <TT>bsearch</TT> example above.

<P>The interactive tracing of attempted rule applications can be achieved
by including antecedents of the following form:-
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breade("\n *** APPLYING MY SPECIAL RULE TO % : ",(#(x,y).P),v) &amp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bsearch((x &lt; y),P,Q) &amp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [x,y := 1,2]Q
&nbsp;&nbsp; =>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #(x,y).P</PRE>
</DD>
<DT>
<A NAME="Guards!bident"></A><TT>bident(x)</TT></DT>

<DD>
succeeds if <TT>x</TT> is a valid&nbsp;<A NAME="Identifier"></A>identifier
(a string of length greater than 1 comprising upper or lower-case letters,
digits and the underscore character, and containing at least one letter).</DD>

<DT>
<TT>bnum(x)</TT></DT>

<DD>
succeeds if <TT>x</TT> is a valid&nbsp;<A NAME="Number"></A>number
(a Natural number less than 2^32).</DD>

<DT>
<TT>bstring(x)</TT></DT>

<DD>
succeeds if <TT>x</TT> is a valid&nbsp;<A NAME="Quoted_String"></A>quoted
string (any character string enclosed in double quotes).


<P>An example is:-
<PRE>    bident(b)
   =>
    {a} \/ {b} == {a,b}</PRE>
</DD>
</DL>
Note the subtle difference in the syntax for <TT>bsearch</TT> and <TT>breade</TT>.
The second argument of <TT>bsearch</TT> must be a list enclosed in brackets,
whereas the list in <TT>breade</TT> does not, giving rise, in effect, to
a variable number of arguments (rather like the <TT>printf</TT> function
in C). The <TT>x</TT> thus refers, in fact, to the last argument.

The semicolon indicates sequencing of actions, and the tilda indicates
repetition. The following is an example of a tactic:-
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( Theory1 ; DED ) ~ ; Theory2~</PRE>
which says, in effect:-
<OL>
<LI>
First attempt to apply any rule from theory <TT>Theory1</TT>, then apply
the special tactic <TT>DED</TT>.</LI>

<LI>
Repeat 1 until no more rules apply.</LI>

<LI>
Then repeatedly apply any rules from <TT>Theory2</TT> until no more apply.</LI>
</OL>
In the <A HREF="InterProver.html#PROOFMETHOD_File">Proof Method</A> files
used by the <A HREF="InterProver.html#InterProver">InterProver</A>, two
tactics are named in the <TT><A HREF="InterProver.html#USETAC_Clause">USETAC</A></TT>
clause (see section on <A HREF="InterProver.html#Tactic!User">InterProver</A>).
The first is the tactic to be used for <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference!Backwards">backwards
inference</A>, and the second is for <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference!Forwards">forwards
inference</A>.

<P>By <A HREF="InterProver.html#Tactic!Default">default</A>, these two
tactics are presented as:-
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (UsersTheory~),
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (FwdUsersTheory~/*;FEQL~*/)</PRE>
and the user is expected to present backwards rules in a theory called
<TT>UsersTheory</TT> and forwards rules in <TT>FwdUsersTheory</TT>.

<P>Note that the application of the special tactic <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Tactic!FEQL">FEQL</A>
is commented out by the annotation marks <TT>/*</TT> and <TT>*/</TT>. It
is placed there to remind users that a frequently desired modification
of the forward tactic is to include the ``<A HREF="BPlatform.html#Tactic!FEQL">forwards
equality</A>'' tactic. In some applications, this modification helps to
push proofs through, often without providing additional rules. It is left
out of the default for efficiency reasons.

<P>The&nbsp;<A NAME="Tactic!Special"></A>special tactics are described
as follows:-
<DL>
<DL>
<DT>
<A NAME="Tactic!DED"></A><TT>DED</TT></DT>

<DD>
The deduction tactic, <TT>DED</TT>, acts on goals of the form

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H1 &amp; H2 &amp; ... Hn&nbsp; =>&nbsp; G</PRE>
by placing the formulae <TT>H1</TT>, <TT>H2</TT> ... <TT>Hn</TT> into the
current set of <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Hypotheses!Current_set">hypotheses</A>,
and making <TT>G</TT> the current goal.
</DD>
<DT>
<A NAME="Tactic!GEN"></A><TT>GEN</TT></DT>

<DD>
The generalisation tactic, <TT>GEN</TT>, acts on goals of the form

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; !v.G</PRE>
by renaming all the variable <TT>v</TT> in <TT>G</TT> to avoid <A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Freeness">free
occurrences</A> in the current set of <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Hypotheses!Current_set">hypotheses</A>,
and making the renamed <TT>G</TT> the new goal.
</DD>
<DT>
<A NAME="Tactic!SUB"></A><TT>SUB</TT></DT>

<DD>
The substitution tactic, <TT>SUB</TT>, acts on goals with contain
sub-formulae of the form

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Substitutions!Application">[v:=F]</A>G</PRE>
by performing the <A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Substitutions!Generalised">substitution</A>
on <TT>G</TT>, and making the rewritten goal the new goal.
</DD>
<DT>
<A NAME="Tactic!HYP"></A><TT>HYP</TT></DT>

<DD>
The ``hypothesis'' tactic, <TT>HYP</TT>, can act in a number of ways.
Suppose the current goal is <TT>Q</TT>:-

<UL>
<LI>
When there is a <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Hypotheses!Current_set">hypothesis</A>
in the current set of the form

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P1 &amp; P2 ... Pn => Q</PRE>
the current goal <TT>Q</TT> is replaced by <TT>P1</TT>, <TT>P2</TT> ...
and <TT>Pn</TT>.
</LI>
<LI>
When there is a hypothesis of the form

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Quantification!Universal">!</A>v.G</PRE>
where <TT>G</TT> is identical to <TT>Q</TT> for some value of <TT>v</TT>,
then the current goal <TT>Q</TT> is discharged.
</LI>
</UL>
</DD>
<DT>
<A NAME="Tactic!FEQL"></A><TT>FEQL</TT></DT>

<DD>
The ``forward equality'' tactic, <TT>FEQL</TT> is a <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Tactic!Forward">forward
tactic</A> which generates new hypotheses from the <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Hypotheses!Current_set">set
of current hypotheses</A> by calculating the transitive closure of equality.

<P>For example, if the <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Hypotheses!Current_set">set
of current hypotheses</A> contains
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; newperson = percy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; newage = 23
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; age <A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Relations!Overriding">+></A> {newperson <A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Ordered_Pair">|-></A> newage} <A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Sets!Inclusion">&lt;:</A> PERSON <A HREF="MathsNotation.html#Functions!Total">--></A> AGE</PRE>
then the FEQL tactic would have the effect of expanding the set to
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; newperson = percy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; newage = 23
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; age +> {newperson |-> newage} &lt;: PERSON --> AGE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; age +> {percy |-> 23} &lt;: PERSON --> AGE</PRE>

<A NAME="Proof!Guidelines"></A>
<H2>
Guidelines for Proof</H2>
The following notes are intended to guide the B-Toolkit in constructing
theories for use with the InterProver.

<P><A NAME="Inference_Rules!Ordering"></A>
<H3>
Ordering Rules in Theories</H3>
When applying rules from a theory, rules are matched in strict biblical
order: the last first, and the first last. This allows a further aspect
of control over which rules are applied: a rule is applied only if all
other rules below it in the theory have not matched.

<P>For example, consider the following theory:-
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THEORY max IS
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; max({p}) == p
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; max({max(P)}\/Q) == max(P\/Q)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; max({P,p}) == maxel({P,p},0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maxel({p},q) == p
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Guards!btest">btest</A>(q>p)&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maxel({p},q) == p
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maxel({P,p},q) == maxel({P},p)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Guards!btest">btest</A>(q>p)&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maxel({P,p},q) == maxel({P},q)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END</PRE>
The last rule is attempted first. This rule is guarded by a <TT><A HREF="BPlatform.html#Guards!btest">btest</A></TT>.
If this fails, then the next rule above is attempted.

<P>The <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference_Rules!Rewrite">rewrite</A> in
the next rule has an identical left-hand side, so the rule will match exactly
when the bottom rule does. This time, however, there is no guard, but we
know from the failure of the rule below that it will only apply when <TT>q&lt;=p</TT>.

<P>Together, these last two rules cover all cases when there are at least
two elements in the set in the first argument of <TT>maxel</TT>.

<P>The next rule up has a rewrite with a different (more general) left-hand
side. The formula <TT>{p}</TT> can match any set, including those of the
form <TT>{P,p}</TT> (see <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Pattern_Match">Pattern
Matching</A>). But we know that, since the previous rules did not match,
the only pattern that remains to be matched is the single set, in which&nbsp;<TT>p</TT> matches
a single element, and not a comma-separated list. A similar argument applies
to the top rule.

<HR WIDTH="40%">
<H3>
Using Guards in Rewrite Rules</H3>
The use of <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Guards">guards</A> is strongly advised
for rewrite rules. This is because there is limited backtracking through
rewrite rules: once they are applied, they cannot be unapplied through
backtracking. There is a need, therefore, to have careful control over
the application of rewrite rules.

<P>The first control over the application of a rewrite rule is through
pattern matching: the rule will only apply if the shape of the left-hand
side of the <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference_Rules!Rewrite">rewrite</A>
matches a sub-formula of the current goal.

<P>A second level of control is by judicious ordering of rewrite rules
in the theory. (See <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference_Rules!Ordering">Ordering
Rules in Theories</A> above.)

<P>A third level of control is by using guards in the <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Antecedent">antecedent</A>
of the rule: if guards evaluate to false, the rule is not applied.

<P>A better version of the <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference_Rules!Rewrite">rewrite
rule</A> example given above is thus:-
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; binhyp(not(s = {}))&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; =>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; max({max(s),x}) == max(s\/{x})</PRE>
since this only allows rewriting when it is known from the current set
of <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Hypotheses!Current_set">hypotheses</A> that
<TT>not(s = {})</TT>.

<HR WIDTH="40%">
<H3>
Backwards versus Forwards Inference</H3>
<A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference!Backwards">Backwards inference</A> is
goal-oriented, in that rules matched against the current goal. It is therefore
inherently more efficient than <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference!Forwards">forwards
inference</A>, which is not goal-directed, since it blindly propagates
knowledge from the <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Hypotheses!Current_set">hypotheses</A>.

<P>It is therefore recommended that <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference_Rules!Simple">simple
rules</A> and <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference_Rules!Rewrite">rewrite
rules</A> are used in preference to <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference_Rules!Forward">forwards
rules</A> where ever possible.

<H3>
Supplying Rules for Animation</H3>
For the purposes of Animation of AMN specifications in the B-Toolkit, a
<A HREF="Animator.html#Users_Theory!in_Animator">theory file</A> can be
supplied containing only guarded or unguarded rewrite rules. Other kinds
of rules would interfere with the animation mechanism. (See section on
the Animator entitled <A HREF="Animator.html#Users_Theory!in_Animator">Providing
More Rewrite Rules</A>.)

<HR WIDTH="60%">

<P><A NAME="B-Platform!Memory"></A>
<H2>
Running Out of Memory</H2>
When conducting really large proofs, it is possible for the B-Platform
to run out of memory. If this occurs, an error message is displayed in
the AutoProver or InterProver panel, and the proof session is aborted.
Hopefully, this situation will not arise, as memory is allocated through
the<I> malloc </I> utility; more memory may be freed by shutting down
other processes, or increasing the swap space of the machine on which
it is running - see your System Administrator.
