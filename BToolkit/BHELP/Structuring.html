The fundamental relationship between entities in the <A
HREF="BMethod.html#B-Method">B-Method</A> is refinement.

<P> <A HREF="refines.gif#">
<IMG SRC="refines_icon.gif" ALT="Refinement Structure" ALIGN=MIDDLE> See figure<LATEX="\ \ref{refines.fig}">.</A>

<P> The REFINEMENT clause is used in
<A HREF="AMNotation.html#REFINEMENT">REFINEMENT</A>s and
<A HREF="AMNotation.html#IMPLEMENTATION">IMPLEMENTATION</A>s
to establish the refinement dependency.

<P> An implementation is a particular form of refinement in which an
implementable subset of <A HREF="AMNotation.html#AMN">AMN</A> is used.

<P> Proof obligations are associated with refinement to establish 
that the refining entity meets the constraints of the refined entity.

<P> It is a matter of <A NAME="Information_Hiding">principle</A> that
REFINEMENTs and IMPLEMENTATIONs are only visible through the MACHINE
that specifies them. MACHINEs are external interfaces, and it is only
MACHINEs that can be cited in the structuring clauses: <A
HREF="Structuring.html#INCLUDES_Clause!Using">INCLUDES</A>, <A
HREF="Structuring.html#USES_Clause!Using">USES</A>, <A
HREF="Structuring.html#IMPORTS_Clause!Using">IMPORTS</A> and <A
HREF="Structuring.html#SEES_Clause!Using">SEES</A>.

<P> It is via this principle that the right separation of concerns is
established for separate implementability and other information-hiding
issues.


<H2>Structuring Machines</H2>

<H3>Purpose</H3>

The goal of structuring a machine is:-

<UL> <LI> to aid in understanding of the specification;

<LI> to factorise commonly used structures;

<LI> to promote reuse;

<LI> to decompose the problem of proving consistency.

</UL>

It is not the primary purpose of structuring a machine to achieve
separate development of components. This is best done by structuring
implementations (see below). It is rather to achieve separation of
proof concerns.


<H3><A NAME="INCLUDES_Clause!Using">Including Machines</A></H3>

The <A HREF="AMNotation.html#INCLUDES_Clause!Syntax">INCLUDES
clause</A> is the main mechanism for structuring large machines.
It allows the abstract system state to be divided into several
independent parts, each encapsulated by a separate included machine.
These parts can then be combined into a single `including' <A
HREF="AMNotation.html#MACHINE">MACHINE</A> using the INCLUDES clause.

<P> <A HREF="includes.gif#"><IMG SRC="includes_icon.gif" ALT="Includes Structure" ALIGN=MIDDLE>
See figure<LATEX="\ \ref{includes.fig}">.</A>

<P> INCLUDES is transitive, i.e. included machines may include other,
and so on, as illustrated in the diagram.  This allows specifications
to be constructed hierarchically. No cycles in the inclusion
relationship are allowed.

<P> If an abstract state can be partitioned
naturally into several independent parts, then it is an advantage to
use this structuring technique.  A measure of this is whether the
operations on the abstract state can be built from operations defined
for the individual parts.

<P> After identifying the independent parts, an included machine is
written for each part. Each included machine will introduce its own
state variables.  To avoid name clashes in the including machine, it
is best to make the name spaces of the included machines
disjoint. 

<P> Several `copies' of the same machine can be included by using <A
HREF="AMNotation.html#Renaming!INCLUDES">machine renaming</A>, which
has the effect of making the name spaces of the two copies
disjoint. Note, however, that names of <A
HREF="AMNotation.html#SETS_Clause">SETS</A> and <A
HREF="AMNotation.html#CONSTANTS_Clause">CONSTANTS</A> do not
participate in the renaming.

<P> A machine is only allowed to change its local state.  So if an
operation of the including machine requires the state for an included
machine to change in a certain way, it can only do this by invoking an
operation on the included machine provided for this purpose.

<P> The including machine state is the combined state of all its
included machines. The operations which change the state are built by
combining operations of the included machines.

<P> <A NAME="Operations!Query">Query operations</A> are those that do
not change the state of a machine. In an including machine, these can
be written by referring directly to any of the included variables.
There is therefore no point in writing query operations in machines
that are only going to be included in another.

<P> The including machine can add to the combined state by defining
its own state variables, whose names must be distinct from those it is
including.

<P> While all the operations of the included machines are available to
the including machine, none of these operations are part of the
interface of the including machine --- unless this is explicitly
specified using the PROMOTES clause.

<P> <A NAME="PROMOTES_Clause!Using">The</A> 
<A HREF="AMNotation.html#PROMOTES_Clause!Syntax">PROMOTES clause</A> 
allows us to specify that an included operation
is part of the interface of the including machine.
It is simply a list of operations which we want to promote.

<A NAME="EXTENDS_Clause!Using">The</A>
<A HREF="AMNotation.html#EXTENDS_Clause!Syntax">EXTENDS clause</A> 
is used instead of INCLUDES if we want to PROMOTE
all included operations.

<P> INCLUDES and EXTENDS can only be used in MACHINEs. The PROMOTES
clause can be used in an 
<A HREF="AMNotation.html#IMPLEMENTATION">IMPLEMENTATION</A>, 
but it promotes imported
operations rather than included operations. 

<P> Included machines cannot be refined. The outermost including machine
is the focus of refinement and implementation.


<H3><A NAME="USES_Clause!Using">Using Machines</A></H3>

The INCLUDES clause allows one machine to have exclusive knowledge of another.
During specification construction using INCLUDES (or EXTENDS), it is
often convenient for included machines to have shared knowledge of the
variables of another included machine. This can be achieved by using
USES. The using machine can reference all the variables of the used
machine, but cannot modify the state of that machine.

<P> The variables of the `used' machine do not become part of the state
of the using machine. They can, however, be quoted anywhere inside the 
`using' machine except on the left-hand side of a substitution.

<P> You can name a parameterised machine in a USES clause, but you are not
allowed to provide parameters. Nor can you reference the formal 
parameters of the used machine in the `using' machine. 

<P> Used machines and their `using' machines must both be included
in the same `including' machine in the overall specification
structure. At this level, all formal parameters of included machines
are provided.

<P> USES is not transitive, i.e. knowledge of variables from a used
machine does <I>not</I> transfer from the using machine to any other
using, including, seeing or importing machine.



<H3>Non-Determinism in Included Machines</H3>

Unbounded <A
HREF="AMNotation.html#Non_Determinism">non-determinism</A> in the
operations of included machines should be avoided. Parameterisation
should be used instead.

<P> The reason for this is that it is not possible to have any
influence on the behaviour of non-deterministic operations from
outside the machine. Through parameterisation, control can be exerted
from without.



<H3>Specification Structure and Proof</H3>

By structuring a specification using INCLUDES, 
not only are proofs of consistency correspondingly smaller,
but the restricted impact of changes to the specification means that 
fewer re-proofs have to be performed when local changes are made.

<P> In the including machine, the proof obligations associated with
included machines are assumed to be valid.
Only if a new invariant is given in the including machine is there
extra work to be done: the operations of the including machine have to
preserve the new invariant.


<H3>Viewing the Structure of Specifications</H3>

The B-Toolkit <A HREF="Overview.html#Overview">Overview Tool</A> can be
used to view the structure of a specification, by selecting the 
<A HREF="Overview.html#Specification_Overview">Specification Overview</A>
option from the Overview menu<LATEX="\ (see page \pageref{Specification_Overview})">.


<H2>Structuring Designs</H2>

<H3>Purpose</H3>

The goal of structuring a design is:-

<UL> <LI> to provide a <A
HREF="Structuring.html#Layered_Approach">layered approach</A> to
design;

<LI> to achieve separate implementability;

<LI> to allow <A HREF="Structuring.html#Code_Sharing">code sharing</A>;

<LI> to ease the difficulty of proof of refinement;

<LI> to encourage reuse of 
<A HREF="SystemLibrary.html#System_Library">system library</A> machines.

</UL>


<H3><A NAME="IMPORTS_Clause!Using">Importing Machines</A></H3>

The <A HREF="AMNotation.html#IMPORTS_Clause!Syntax">IMPORTS clause</A>
is the main mechanism for structuring designs. An <A
HREF="AMNotation.html#IMPLEMENTATION">IMPLEMENTATION</A> imports
specifications of lower layers of design, allowing the design to be
hierarchically structured.

<P> <A HREF="imports.gif#"><IMG SRC="imports_icon.gif" ALT="Imports Structure" ALIGN=MIDDLE>
See figure<LATEX="\ \ref{imports.fig}">.</A>

<P> The full information hiding enforced by importing allows the imported
machines to be separately developed.

<P> When a machine is imported, it is also instantiated by providing
values for its formal parameters.

<P> The `leaves' of the development tree in the B-Method are always
pre-implemented library machines. Where more than one instance of a
library machine is imported, the library machines have to be
renamed so that the name is unique across the whole development.
Thus no sharing of code can be achieved through importing alone.


<H3><A NAME="SEES_Clause!Using">Seeing Machines</A></H3>

The <A HREF="AMNotation.html#SEES_Clause!Syntax">SEES clause</A> is
used in <A HREF="AMNotation.html#REFINEMENT">REFINEMENT</A>s and <A
HREF="AMNotation.html#IMPLEMENTATION">IMPLEMENTATION</A>s for the
purpose of <A NAME="Code_Sharing">sharing code</A>, and giving access to
shared data.

<P> Machines that are imported once somewhere in a development can be
`seen' elsewhere in the development by citing the `seen' machine in a
SEES clause. The code for the seen machine is linked only once in the
development.

<P> This establishes a `one writer, many readers' sharing
scheme. Where the machine is imported, all operations can be invoked
in the importing machine to effect state changes in the seen machine,
corresponding to `write' access. Where the machine is seen, only query
operations can be invoked, corresponding to `read-only' access.

<P> A <A NAME="Stateless_Machine">stateless machine</A> is one which has
no abstract state variables. Since they are stateless, all their
operations are queries, and citing them in a SEES clause gives access
to them all.

<P> Stateless machines are typically used for sharing separately
implemented system-wide types. Examples of these can be found
in the <A HREF="SystemLibrary.html#SLIB">System Library</A>, such as
SCALAR, BOOL, STRING. These machines contain mathematics and
operations, and have an implementation.

<P> Stateless machine may also be operation-less. These can be used
for sharing a particular mathematical context between several
machines.  Rather than copying the same definitions into the <A
HREF="AMNotation.html#CONSTANTS_Clause">CONSTANTS</A> and <A
HREF="AMNotation.html#PROPERTIES_Clause">PROPERTIES</A> clauses of
several machines, the definitions can be placed in a separate
state-less (and operation-less) machine. This machine can then be
cited in the SEES clause of every machine that needs the definitions.

<P> The SEES clause can be used to share such machines at any layer of
development. In fact, since SEES is not transitive, the sees machine
will often have to be cited in the SEES clause of several machines
down through the hierarchy.

<P> <A HREF="sees.gif#"><IMG SRC="sees_icon.gif" ALT="Sees Structure" ALIGN=MIDDLE>
See figure<LATEX="\ \ref{sees.fig}">.</A>

<P> By importing a stateless machine once and seeing it many times,
only one copy of the code is present in the final system.  If a
machine is imported twice in a development, <A
NAME="Linker!Name_Clashes">name clashes</A> will arise during <A
HREF="Linker.html#Linker">linking</A>.

<P> Operation-less machines may not need refining. Since it is just
mathematics that they contain, the definitions may simply be
`programmed away' in the algorithms used in the main
development. However, from a book-keeping point of view, a dummy
IMPLEMENTATION has to be present before linking can take place. This
dummy implementation can take the following form:-

<PRE>
    IMPLEMENTATION
        My_Maths_I
    REFINES
        My_Maths
    END
</PRE>

If such an implementation has not been provided, the user will be
notified if he attempts <A
HREF="Translator.html#Translator">translation</A>.

<P> As with the <A HREF="Structuring.html#USES_Clause!Using">USES</A>
clause above, you can name a parameterised machine in a SEES clause,
but you are not allowed to provide parameters. Formal parameters are
provided where the `seen' machines is imported in the development.

<P> SEES is not transitive, i.e. knowledge of variables from a seen
machine does <I>not</I> transfer from the seeing machine to any other
using, including, seeing or importing machine.


<H3><A NAME="Layered_Approach">Hierarchical Design</A></H3>

The <A HREF="Structuring.html#IMPORTS_Clause">IMPORTS</A> clause
allows a development to be structured into layers of
specification/implementation pairs. The <A
HREF="AMNotation.html#IMPLEMENTATION">IMPLEMENTATION</A>s of one layer
import the specifications of the layer below.

<P> <A HREF="hierarchy.gif#"><IMG SRC="hierarchy_icon.gif" 
ALT="A Typical Hierarchical Design" ALIGN=MIDDLE>
See figure<LATEX="\ \ref{hierarchy.fig}">.</A>

<P> It is this capability that makes medium to large-scale software
development possible with the <A
HREF="BMethod.html#B-Method">B-Method</A> and <A
HREF="BToolkit.html#B-Toolkit">B-Toolkit</A>. Monolithic refinement of
a single large specification into code is impractical.  Hierarchical
design allows complex systems to be specified abstractly, and
implemented in detail, all within the same formal framework.

<P> The specifications of each descending layer introduce more and
more detail. The structure of the top level machine does not have to
be strongly reflected in the structures of the machines in the next
level down. Thus in the top level the most abstract machines can be
presented in the most convenient way for specification purposes,
whilst in the lower layers, they can be organised in the best way for
implementation concerns, such as space and time efficiency.

<P> There is no prescribed way of proceeding with a hierarchical
design. Top-down or bottom-up designs are possible, and a mixture of
the two is usually adopted.

<P> The following is a typical approach:-

<OL> <LI> We begin by specifying the machines of a middle layer, in
which the essential functionality of the system is captured. <A
HREF="Animator.html#Animator">Animation</A> and proof of consistency
are used to establish the desired properties of the system at this
stage.

<P><LI> A lower layer of machines are specified, in which the previous
layer of step 1 can be implemented. These machines may be drawn from
the <A HREF="SystemLibrary.html#SLIB">System Library</A>, or invented for a
specific purpose. Again, Animation and proof of consistency are used
here.

<P><LI> The layer specified at step 1 is now implemented in terms of the
lower layer at step 2. Proofs of refinement are carried out to verify
the design so far.

<P><LI> Development can proceed downwards towards code in a similar
fashion, repeating steps 2 and 3.

<P><LI> The final step is to construct a top layer which presents the
specific application's functionality through an appropriate
interface. Where the machines specified in the middle layer of step 1
may, for convenience of specification, have preconditions, the top
layer is usually robust. Code is added to check that preconditions are
preserved before invoking operations from the middle layer.

</OL>

<P> The middle layer can be used to provide an abstract instruction
set specially designed to support a range of applications in the
problem domain. The top layer then uses the generic functionality to
implement a particular application. This approach encourages the
maximum of reuse of specifications, designs and code.

<P> A top layer can simply be a `main' program (an operation
called <TT>main</TT>), which must exist before code can be executed.

<P>One way of constructing such a top layer is by using the
<A HREF="Interface.html#Interface_Generator">Interface Generator</A><LATEX="\ (see page \pageref{Interface!Generator})">,
which constructs a default main program with an interface that allows
the operations of the middle layers to be invoked.


<H3>Design Structure and Proof</H3>

By structuring a development using <A
HREF="Structuring.html#IMPORTS_Clause">IMPORTS</A>, it is possible to
`divide and conquer' the problem of proof of refinement, as well as
that of development.

<P> The proofs of consistency of imported machines can be assumed
in proofs concerning the importing machine.

<P> Not only are proofs of refinement correspondingly smaller,
but the restricted impact of changes to the development means that 
fewer re-proofs have to be performed.


<H3>Viewing the Structure of Designs</H3>

The B-Toolkit <A HREF="Overview.html#Overview">Overview Tool</A> can be
used to view the structure of a design, by selecting the 
<A HREF="Overview.html#Design_Overview">Design Overview</A>
option from the Overview menu.

<P> In this option, the <A HREF="Overview.html#Overview">Overview Tool</A>
displays the hierarchical structure
established by the IMPORTS clauses in the development.
