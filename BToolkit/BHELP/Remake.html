Remake is available on the 
<A HREF="BToolkit.html#TopBar!Remake">TopBar
Remake</A> pull-down.
<P>
A record of the most advanced state of development reached by each
<A HREF="BToolkit.html#Constructs!Area">construct</A> 
is maintained by the system. If the status of any construct
(or constructs) is changed (e.g. by editing it) then it is possible to
restore the development to its most advanced state from its current
state by use of the Remake facility. The Remake tool causes all the
necessary tools to be applied to the appropriate constructs
automatically until either an error is encountered or the most
advanced state is restored.
<P>
Two choices are initially offered:
<UL>
   <LI> Remake all constructs
   <LI> Remake construct(s)
</UL>
<P>
Selection of the first produces a menu of jobs for all constructs in
the development which should be carried out for a full remake;
selection of the second produces a menu of constructs from which one
or more may be selected, when a menu of jobs relating to those
constructs is subsequently produced.
<P>
In both cases, the jobs presented depend on the current setting of the
<A HREF="Options.html#Options!Remake">Remake Options</A>; 
each of the following tools
may be included in or excluded form the Remake:
<UL>
<LI>      POGenerator
<LI>      AutoProver
<LI>      ProofPrinter
<LI>      DocumentMarkUp
<LI>      Translator
<LI>      Linker
<LI>      ITFGenerator
</UL>
<P>
In both cases, the list of jobs presented is pre-selected, and jobs
may be de-selected in the usual way to enable a partial remake to be
achieved.
<P>
Before the initial two choices are offered, however, if one or more
constructs have been 
<A HREF="Editor.html#Editor">edited</A> 
and the (saved) version in the 
<A HREF="BToolkit.html#Development_Environment">SRC</A>
directory differs from that of the committed version in the 
<A HREF="BToolkit.html#Development_Environment">CFG</A>
directory, the tool will, for each such file, prompt for 
<A HREF="Commit.html#Commit">committing</A>
before proceeding in the same manner as the 
<A HREF="Analyser.html#Analyser">Analyser</A>. 
Accepting the
commit option will have the same effect as that described for the
<A HREF="CommitEdits.html#CommitEdits">CommitEdit</A> 
tool.
