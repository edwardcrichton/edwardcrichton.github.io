The InterProver is invoked from the <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Environments!Provers">Provers

<A HREF="three_provers.gif">See figure</A>

<P>It is applicable to all
<A HREF="AMNotation.html#MACHINE">machines</A>,
<A HREF="AMNotation.html#REFINEMENT">refinements</A> and
<A HREF="AMNotation.html#IMPLEMENTATION">implementations</A>
which are <A HREF="POGenerator.html#Proof_Obligation!Generator">pogenerated</A>
and currently have undischarged proof obligations.

<P>If the <A HREF="AutoProver.html#AutoProver">AutoProver</A> fails to
discharge all the proof obligations for a given construct then proofs of
the remaining obligations may be attempted by entering the AutoProver-InterProver
cycle which has the following structure:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- InterProver</PRE>
The InterProver allows you to investigate why the <A HREF="AutoProver.html#AutoProver">AutoProver</A>
has failed to discharge a proof obligation. It is stressed that it is a
BROWSING tool (no `proofs' are committed to the system) which facilitates
the inspection of the points at which the AutoProver failed in its attempts
to discharge a proof obligation. It enables you to supplement the AutoProver's
standard in-built library of mathematical laws with additional laws of
your own through the user's <A HREF="InterProver.html#PROOFMETHOD_File">PROOFMETHOD
file</A>.

<P>InterProving comprises two distinct phases:
<OL>
<LI>
Finding an appropriate point in the INCOMPLETE proof where you think you
can provide the mathematical insight to enable the proof to proceed. This
is achieved by <A HREF="InterProver.html#Lemma_creation">creating one or
more lemmas</A>. This phase uses only the in-built tactics and theory of
the AutoProver.</LI>

<LI>
Providing the necessary mathematics in order to COMPLETE the proof. This
is achieved by <A HREF="InterProver.html#Lemma_proof">discharging the lemmas</A>.
This phase uses the in-built tactics and theory of the AutoProver supplemented
by user-provided theory and tactics.</LI>
</OL>
Although the InterProver actually constructs proofs, its browsing nature
means that such proofs are not committed to the system. The idea is that,
having demonstrated to yourself that the mathematical insight that you
have provided is sufficient, you then leave the InterProver and invoke
the <A HREF="AutoProver.html#AutoProver">AutoProver</A>, which constructs
the next level of proof using your <A HREF="InterProver.html#PROOFMETHOD_File">PROOFMETHOD</A>
file, which you have already demonstrated is adequate.

<P>The InterProver is invoked from the <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Environments!Provers">Provers
Environment</A> by first selecting a construct and then activating the
InterProver. You are then presented with a selection-list of item
names (e.g. operation names). For each item the number of (unproved) proof
obligations associated with this item is given.

<P>An editor window is also presented which contains the appropriate <A HREF="InterProver.html#PROOFMETHOD_File">PROOFMETHOD
file</A>, if one exists, or a template proof method file otherwise. This
template can be edited to provide the provers with user-supplied laws of
mathematics and proof tactics, as described below. (Each prover cycle (InterProver
- AutoProver) creates a new ``proof level'' with its own <A HREF="InterProver.html#PROOFMETHOD_File">PROOFMETHOD
file</A> stored in the environment subdirectory <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Development_Environment">PMD</A>).

<P>On selection of one of the items (e.g. operation), another selection
list of the proof obligations outstanding for that item is presented. Once
one of these proof obligations has been selected, that proof obligation
is displayed as the <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Goals!Current">Current Goal</A>
for the InterProver and you are presented with a menu of options for driving
the InterProver in producing an INCOMPLETE proof.

<HR><A NAME="Lemma_creation"></A>
<H2>
The First Phase - Creation of Lemmas</H2>
The options are initially:
<UL>
<LI>
Run Prover</LI>

<LI>
Create Lemma</LI>
</UL>
The `Run Prover' option uses the rules in the standard library in an attempt
prove the Current Goal; the InterProver uses the same standard library
as the <A HREF="AutoProver.html#AutoProver">AutoProver</A>.

<P>Selecting the `Run Prover' may result in either the goal being discharged
or in the InterProver encountering a goal for which no standard rules apply,
when it stops and presents the options:
<UL>
<LI>
Backtrack</LI>

<LI>
Show Hypotheses</LI>

<LI>
Create Lemma</LI>
</UL>
The `Create Lemma' option discharges the <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Goals!Current">Current
Goal</A> through the creation of a&nbsp;<A NAME="Lemma"></A>Lemma; this
should be employed if you believe that the Current Goal is provable, and
that you can easily supply some additional laws of mathematics which prove
that lemma. (At this point you might provide these additional laws by entering
them as rules in the UsersTheory in the provided <A HREF="InterProver.html#PROOFMETHOD_File">PROOFMETHOD
file</A>, although they won't be used until the <A HREF="InterProver.html#Lemma_proof">second
phase</A>).

<P>The hypotheses associated with the Current Goal can be displayed through&nbsp;<A NAME="Hypotheses!Viewing"></A>`Show
Hypotheses' at any time. This might assist you in assessing whether a goal
is provable. The <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Hypotheses!Current_set">current
set of hypotheses</A> is displayed inside an editor or other tool specified
though the <A HREF="Options.html#Options!Editor!Hyp_Editor">Hypothesis
Editor (Viewer)</A> setting of the <A HREF="Options.html#Options">Options</A>.

<P>The `Backtrack' option provides a&nbsp;<A NAME="Backtracking"></A>backtracking
mechanism, and should be selected if you think that the Proof Obligation
is provable and if you think that the Current Goal is too difficult to
justify. Selecting run will backtrack to an intermediate goal and you will
at this stage be informed by the InterProver of how (and why) the goal,
from which you are backtracking, were produced.

<P>The intermediate goals presented may be altered by setting the `InterProver
Reasoning Depth' to the appropriate level of forward reasoning:
<UL>
<LI>
InterProver Depth 0</LI>

<LI>
InterProver Depth 1</LI>

<LI>
InterProver Depth 2</LI>
</UL>
(The effects of these settings are the same as those described for the
<A HREF="InterProver.html#Reasoning_Depth">REASONING_DEPTH</A> clause of
the PROOFMETHOD)

<P>In order to use the InterProver to produce an INCOMPLETE proof for a
Proof Obligation you will have to create a lemma at some point of your
choosing, either for a final goal or an intermediate goal. If you do not
create any lemmas then repeated use of the run option will eventually return
you to the Original Proof Obligation.

<P>If you need to investigate the proof attempt again you can repeat the
run. Note that a single proof obligation may give rise to several lemmas.
During this first phase, the <A HREF="InterProver.html#PROOFMETHOD_File">PROOFMETHOD</A>
is not consulted, and so the intermediate goals that are presented stem
from the <A HREF="AutoProver.html#AutoProver">AutoProver's</A> in-built
tactics and theory. It is possible to change the intermediate goals only
through the the setting of the `InterProver Reasoning Depth'.

<P>The display shows the Original Proof Obligation and the Current Goal
(on which the AutoProver can currently make no progress):

<P><A HREF="lemma_creation.gif#"><IMG SRC="lemma_creation_icon.gif" ALT="Lemma Creation" ALIGN=MIDDLE></A><A HREF="lemma_creation.gif#">
See figure<LATEX="\ \ref{lemma_creation.fig}">.</A>

<P>A combination of the Current Hypotheses and the Current Goal provides
the information necessary to enable the user to decide whether or not to
create a lemma, and assist in providing the mathematics to be used in the
discharge of that lemma in the second phase (all rules are written in the
<A HREF="BPlatform.html#B-Theory_Language">B-Theory Language</A> of the<A HREF="BPlatform.html#">BPlatform</A>):

<P><A HREF="proofmethod_rule.gif#"><IMG SRC="proofmethod_rule_icon.gif" ALT="PROOFMETHOD Rule" ALIGN=MIDDLE></A><A HREF="proofmethod_rule.gif#">
See figure<LATEX="\ \ref{proofmethod_rule.fig}">.</A>

<P>Having created one or more lemmas (which are stored in a selectable
item called `Lemmas') you can attempt to prove them completely by returning
to the `Select Theory' option - through `Cancel' - and selecting the Lemmas
item. Note that when a proof obligation is discharged by the creation of
lemmas, you are automatically returned to the `Select Theory' option.

<HR><A NAME="Lemma_proof"></A>
<H2>
The Second Phase - Proof of Lemmas</H2>
This second phase - attempting the proof of a lemma - now simulates the
action of the <A HREF="AutoProver.html#AutoProver">AutoProver</A> which
is dictated by the <A HREF="InterProver.html#PROOFMETHOD_File">PROOFMETHOD</A>
file, and so, after selection of a particular Lemma, that file is automatically
loaded (provided that it parses!), and you the are presented with the choice:
<UL>
<LI>
Run Prover</LI>

<LI>
Show Hypotheses</LI>

<LI>
Reload PROOFMETHOD</LI>
</UL>
Note that there is now no `Backtracking' option, and that the `InterProver
Reasoning Depth' option is no longer available (this is now a simulation
of the <A HREF="AutoProver.html#AutoProver">AutoProver</A>).

<P>On selection of `Run Prover' your <A HREF="InterProver.html#PROOFMETHOD_File">PROOFMETHOD
file</A> is used by the system to attempt a COMPLETE proof. A tracing mechanism
indicates which of your rules are applied, and to which goals they are
applied, in order to assist in understanding the proof process.

<P><A HREF="lemma_proof.gif#"><IMG SRC="lemma_proof_icon.gif" ALT="Lemma Proof"  ALIGN=MIDDLE></A><A HREF="lemma_proof.gif#">
See figure<LATEX="\ \ref{lemma_proof.fig}">.</A>

<P>If the attempt is unsuccessful, the tracing information provided should
be sufficient to indicate the way in which the PROOFMETHOD should be edited,
and having done this it may be loaded using the `Reload' option when the
previous PROOFMETHOD is removed and the current one loaded.

<P>The `Show Hypotheses' option will show the hypothesis associated with
the final goal produced during a failed attempt to prove a lemma. Note
that when the <A HREF="InterProver.html#PROOFMETHOD_File">PROOFMETHOD</A>
is reloaded all previously proved lemmas re-appear (since they may no longer
be provable once the proof method has been edited!).

<P>You can follow this cycle as many times as you want until either the
lemma is proved, or you wish to abort the attempt - through `Cancel'.

<HR><A NAME="Users_Theory!in_InterProver"></A>
<H2>
<A NAME="PROOFMETHOD_File"></A>The PROOFMETHOD file</H2>
The PROOFMETHOD file resides in the environment subdirectory <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Development_Environment">PMD</A>
and is automatically presented for editing during InterProof. It may also
be edited through the `pmd' button of the <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Environments!Provers">Provers
Environment</A>.

<P>The syntax of a proof method is:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PROOFMETHOD
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IS
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="USETAC_Clause"></A>USETAC tactic&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ REASONING_DEPTH&nbsp; n1 ]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ ON lemma_list ]&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ &amp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THEORY th1 IS rules1 END&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THEORY thN IS rulesN END ]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DEFINITIONS
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rewrite_rule [ ; rewrite_rule ]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INCLUSIONS
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incl_file [ , incl_file ]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]</PRE>
Theories <TT>th1,..,thN</TT> contain the user-supplied rules: <TT>rules1,..,rulesN</TT>.

<P>The optional&nbsp;<A NAME="PMD_DEFINITIONS_Clause"></A>DEFINITIONS clause
allows macro definitions in the form of <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Inference_Rules!Rewrite">rewrite
rules</A> to be applied to the user-supplied Theories before use. A DEFINITIONS
clause comprising `?' is equivalent to an empty clause.

<P>The optional&nbsp;<A NAME="PMD_INCLUSIONS_Clause"></A>INCLUSIONS
clause allows other PROOFMETHOD files to be loaded (and, of course, the
process is recursive). For such included files, however, the USETAC, REASONING_DEPTH
and ON clauses are ignored; those settings are taken from the main PROOFMETHOD
file.

<P>Each inclusion should be the name of a PROOFMETHOD file enclosed in
double quotes, and for proof levels other than zero, the default file produced
by the system contains a single INCLUSIONS entry comprising the previous-level
PROOFMETHOD file. An INCLUSIONS clause comprising `?' is equivalent to
an empty clause.

<P>The optional&nbsp;<A NAME="Reasoning_Depth"></A>REASONING_DEPTH clause
enables the provers to work with different sets of `forward' rules:-
<UL>
<LI>
when <TT>n1</TT> = 0

<P>only a simple set of rules for recognising mathematical contradictions
are used, and furthermore the antecedent of the proof-obligations is not
inspected during proofs;</P>
</LI>
<LI>
when <TT>n1</TT> = 1

<P>the antecedent of the proof-obligations is used and a simple set of
rules for producing further consequences from the specific antecedent are
used;</P>
</LI>
<LI>
when <TT>n1</TT> = 2

<P>an extended set of rules for producing consequences are used.</P>
</LI>
</UL>
NOTE: the performance of the provers is affected by this setting.

<P>The optional&nbsp;<A NAME="ON_Clause"></A>ON clause enables the AutoProver
to subsequently attempt to prove a subset of undischarged proof obligations;
`lemma_list' is a comma-separated list containing either:
<UL>
<LI>
name

<P>(e.g. an operation name) indicating that all outstanding obligations
of that name should be attempted
</P></LI>
<LI>
name.n

<P>indicating that only the n-th obligation of name should be attempted
</P></LI>
<LI>
name.(n,m,..)

<P>indicating that name.n, name.m, name... should be attempted.
</P></LI>
</UL>
If the ON clause is omitted, the AutoProver will use the supplied tactics
to attempt all unproved proof obligations.

<P>The <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Tactic">tactic</A> is a standard B-TL tactic,
i.e. a pair <TT>(b,f)</TT> consisting of a <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Tactic!Normal">normal
tactic</A> <TT>b</TT> and a <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Tactic!Forward">forward
tactic</A> <TT>f</TT>. (See section called ``<A HREF="BPlatform.html#B-Platform">B-Platform</A>''
for a discussion of proof and tactics.)

<P>In attempting a COMPLETE proof, the InterProver and the <A HREF="AutoProver.html#AutoProver">AutoProver</A>
will follow their own in-built tactics until a goal is (or goals are) generated
which the Provers cannot match. At this point, the supplied&nbsp;<A NAME="Tactic!User"></A>user
tactics are adopted.

<P>Each generated PROOFMETHOD file is provided with a&nbsp;<A NAME="Tactic!Default"></A>default
tactic, which may be edited by the user. The default normal tactic is
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<A NAME="Users_Theory!UsersTheory"></A>UsersTheory~)</PRE>
which is the theory (provided through the <A HREF="InterProver.html#PROOFMETHOD_File">PROOFMETHOD</A>)
that the provers tactic switches to after the in-built tactic is tried.
If progress is made through one of the rules in `UsersTheory', the tactic
switches back to the in-built tactic until no progress can be made; again
the tactic switches to that of the PROOFMETHOD file and the process repeats
until either the proof is complete, or no further progress can be made.
The in-built tactic also incorporates a backtracking mechanism so that
all possible proofs are attempted before the process is deemed to have
been unsuccessful.

<P>The default forward tactic is
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<A NAME="Users_Theory!FwdUsersTheory"></A>FwdUsersTheory~/*;FEQL~*/)</PRE>
Here, FwdUsersTheory is employed (together with <A HREF="BPlatform.html#Tactic!FEQL">FEQL</A>
if not commented out) before the library's standard forward tactic.

<P>You should always edit the PROOFMETHOD file using the InterProver editor,
since this editor is the means of propagating the effects of changes in
the proof method file to the configuration tools (i.e. recording the `level'
in the prover cycle).

<P>Having proved all (or some) of the outstanding proof obligations the
cycle is completed by returning to the top level of the prover environment
and invoking the AutoProver; it uses the proof method file just edited
to discharge more proof obligations and, if proof obligations remain, a
new level is generated, enabling the cycle to be repeated.

<HR WIDTH="60%">
<H3>
<A NAME="GlobalPMD"></A>The Global PROOFMETHOD File</H3>
A Global PROOFMETHOD may be specified in the <A HREF="Options.html#Options!Provers">Provers
Options</A>; if set it is automatically inserted into the <A HREF="#PMD_INCLUSIONS_Clause">INCLUSIONS</A>
clause of all newly-created PROOFMETHODs; it may also, of course, be manually
inserted or removed when editing a PROOFMETHOD.
