The Editor</H1>
The `opn/clo' option may be invoked from all environments selectable from
the <A HREF="BToolkit.html#EnvironmentPanel">EnvironmentPanel</A>, and
for all constructs. It represents a toggle for opening/closing (quitting
from) a construct edit; if the <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Constructs!Area">construct</A>
is currently open, the option label is printed in inverse video.

<HR WIDTH="60%">
<H2>
Open Editor</H2>
A copy of the <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Development_Environment">CFG</A> file
is first made in the <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Development_Environment">SRC</A>
directory; if a file of that name currently exists in SRC, and differs
from that in CFG, the following options are offered:
<UL>
<LI>
<TT>Open SRC file</TT><BR>

<P>
opens the SRC file, when edits may subsequently be committed in the
usual way.
</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<TT>Open CFG file</TT>

<P>opens the CFG file and in so-doing overwrites the edited SRC file (which
is thus lost); edits may subsequently be committed in the usual way.
</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<TT>Show difference</TT>

<P>displays the UNIX diff between the two files.</P>
</LI>
</UL>
<HR WIDTH="60%">
The editor setting is made though the <A HREF="Options.html#Options!Editor!Construct_Editor">Construct
Editor</A> setting of the <A HREF="Options.html#Options">Options</A>.
<H2>
Quit Editor</H2>
If the currently-edited <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Development_Environment">SRC</A>
file is the same as the <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Development_Environment">CFG</A>
file, the following prompt is displayed:
<PRE>&nbsp; Quit editor requested, but no changes saved!

&nbsp; `Cancel' if you want to save any changes ...</PRE>
to ensure that any edits made which have not been saved are not unintentionally
lost. The `OK' option causes the edit to be killed, with no commit therefore
being necessary.

<P>However, if there is a difference between the <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Development_Environment">SRC</A>
and <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Development_Environment">CFG</A> files (i.e.
the edited file differs from that which is currently committed), the following
choice is offered:
<UL>
<LI>
<TT>Commit edits</TT>

<P>updates the CFG directory, and in so doing causes any processing of
the construct to be lost; further, processing of any dependent constructs
is also lost (but you will be warned in this case before the commit is
actually made). If the difference is annotational, the processing lost
is restricted to marked-up documents.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<TT>Discard edits</TT>

<P>removes the edited SRC file from the file system.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<TT>Save in SRC</TT>

<P>does not commit the edited file, but leaves it in the SRC directory
for later use.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<TT>Show difference</TT>

<P>displays the UNIX diff between the SRC and CFG files.</P>
</LI>
</UL>
It is also possible to commit the changes of an edited construct through
the <A HREF="Close.html#Close">Close</A>, <A HREF="CommitEdits.html#CommitEdits">CommitEdits</A>,
<A HREF="Commit.html#Commit">Commit</A>, <A HREF="Remake.html#Remake">Remake</A>,
<A HREF="Analyser.html#Analyser">Analyser</A>, <A HREF="POGenerator.html#POGenerator">POGenerator</A>
and <A HREF="MiniRemake.html#MiniRemake">Mini-Remake</A> tools.

<P><U>NOTE</U>

<P>If the editor is closed by the user, this will be dected by the BToolkit
and the option label will indicate that the construct is now closed (ie.
it will be printed in normal video); an information popup will confirm
that the closure of the editor has been detected. Any edits made will,
of course, remain in the&nbsp; <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Development_Environment">SRC</A>
directory, and the construct <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Constructs!Decoration">button
decoration</A> will indicate if there is any difference between that file
and the one currently configured in <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Development_Environment">CFG</A>;
if the two files differ edits may be committed without opening the construct
through<TT> <A HREF="Commit.html#Commit">Commit All Updated Constructs</A>
</TT>invoked from the<TT> <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Construct">TopBar Constructs</A>
pull-down.</TT>
