The SaveDevelopment facility is available under the
<A HREF="BToolkit.html#Utilities">TopBar
Utils</A> pull-down
and provides
a means of saving the current state of the development.
<P>
A prompt for a directory name is given, and the directory is created in
the current development directory (and so should not already exist -
an error results in this case), and then a reset version of the
development is written to the newly-created directory.
<P>
The directory may subsequently be viewed as a normal development
directory in its own right; it is relocatable, and when the B-Toolkit
is invoked, 
<A HREF="Remake.html#Remake">Remake</A> 
will restore it to
the state immediately prior to which it was saved.
<P>
The contents of the directory thus represents the minimal information
required for a system rebuild; thus it may be regarded as a candidate
for archiving, compression, incorporation into software control
systems, and so on.
