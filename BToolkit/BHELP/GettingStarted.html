Before using the <A HREF="BToolkit.html#B-Toolkit">B-Toolkit</A> the <A HREF="BEnvironment.html#Environment">$BKIT</A>
environment variable must be correctly set, and the licence daemon
<A HREF="BToolkitd.html">BToolkitd</A> must be running.

<P>Other settings should then be made through the <A HREF="Options.html#Options">Options</A>
once the B-Toolkit has been started.

<P>The B-Toolkit is invoked by issuing the command <TT>$BKIT/BToolkit</TT>
(or just <TT>BToolkit</TT> if the directory <TT>$BKIT</TT> is in the current
path) from a suitable development directory - any directory in which you
have read-write permission and which you intend to be the top-level directory
for all new specification, design and implementation source files in this
development.

<A NAME="firstTimeInvocation"></A>
<P>If the toolkit is invoked for the first time in a directory where
there is no existing development environment, the 
<A HREF="ChangeDirectory.html">Change Directory</A> file selection panel
appears; if the subsequently selected directory is not already
an existing BToolkit development directory, a motif panel appears to
ask the user whether a new environment should be created.


<P><A HREF="initmotif.gif#"><IMG SRC="initmotif_icon.gif" ALT="The B-Toolkit environment creation panel" ALIGN=BOTTOM></A><A HREF="initmotif.gif#">
See figure<LATEX=" \ref{initmotif.fig}">.</A>

<P>If the reply
is <TT><U>C</U>ancel</TT> then the toolkit is exited (unless
called through <TT><A HREF="ChangeDirectory.html">TopBar->Utils->ChangeDirectory</A> </TT>); if the reply is <TT>OK</TT>
a new development environment is created, consisting of a set of <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Development_Environment">development
directories</A> and configuration files.&nbsp;<LATEX="(See Section~\ref{Development_Environment}).">

<HR WIDTH="60%">
<H2>The Windows</H2>
The <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Interface!Motif">Motif interface</A> to the
B-Toolkit consists of two windows: the session window (the window from
which the toolkit is invoked) and the B-Toolkit Motif panel (which is created).
All interaction takes place in the main panel.&nbsp;<LATEX="\begin{figure}
\label{mainpanel}
\leavevmode\epsfbox{interface.eps}
\caption{The B-Toolkit main panel}
\end{figure}">

<P>On start-up, the B-Toolkit Motif panel appears<LATEX="as portrayed in Figure~\ref{mainpanel}">.
The panel is divided into a number of distinct areas as follows, starting
from the top:
<UL>
<LI>
The <TT><A HREF="BToolkit.html#Top_Bar">Top Bar</A></TT> which gives access
to a number of general facilities.</LI>

<LI>
The <A HREF="BToolkit.html#EnvironmentPanel">Environment Panel</A> for
changing environments (initially the <A HREF="BToolkit.html#Environments!Main">Main
Environment</A>) including the <A HREF="BToolkit.html#B_Logo">B Logo</A>.</LI>

<LI>
A Panel displaying the set of command tools appropriate to the current
environment.</LI>

<LI>
The <TT><A HREF="BToolkit.html#Constructs!Area">Constructs Area</A></TT>
which lists, down the right-hand side, all of the constructs currently
under configuration management. The term ``construct'' is used to refer
to the different types of Abstract Machine (machine, refinement or implementation)
and also to ``system bases'', ``set enumerations'', ``interfaces'', ``documents'',
``proof files'' and so on. A number of different files may be associated
with each construct. Down the left-hand side are columns of buttons for
the invocation of various commands on the corresponding construct. These
commands are indicated in the <TT><A HREF="BToolkit.html#Command_Bar">Command
Bar</A></TT> above the constructs area. Only those commands whose buttons
are in full colour can be invoked; this serves to indicate, also, the status
of each construct.</LI>

<LI>
The <TT><A HREF="BToolkit.html#Display_Area">Display Area</A></TT> which
serves to display messages from the toolkit relating to its current activity.</LI>
</UL>
The <TT><A HREF="BToolkit.html#Constructs!Area">Constructs Area</A></TT>
and <TT><A HREF="BToolkit.html#Display_Area">Display Area</A></TT> together
form a paned window; their relative sizes can be altered by vertically
sliding the grip that appears on the right between them.&nbsp;<A NAME="Mouse"></A>

<HR WIDTH="60%">
<H2>The Mouse</H2>
Only the left-hand mouse button is used in the B-Toolkit interface. It
is used to select menus, tools and commands by a single click. Clicking
on many of the main panel entities will also bring up on-line help information.
Double-clicking on items in selection boxes is a short-cut for a single
click on that item, followed by clicking on the OK button to perform the
default action.

<H2>Subsidiary Panels</H2>
Some of the commands activated from the Main panel popup a subsidiary panel
associated with output from the <A HREF="BPlatform.html#B-Platform">B-Platform<LATEX="(see
section~\ref{B-Platform})"></A>.
This panel displays information as the tool is executed, after which it
is popped down leaving a copy of the display in the Display area in the
Main panel.

<P>Other panels are described under the appropriate tool descriptions.
<H2>The Top Bar</H2>
Except for <TT><U>I</U>nterrupt</TT>, each item on the Menu bar activates
a pull-down menu; selection is either by clicking with the mouse, or from
the keyboard by using the 'command' key (marked with a diamond) simultaneously
with the underlined letter in the menu name (its mnemonic).

<P>Whilst a pull-down menu is activated, little other screen or keyboard
action is permitted other than to select an item on that menu with the
mouse. A menu can be de-activated by clicking elsewhere on the Menu bar.
All pull-down menus may be ``torn off'' and displayed in a separate window
(the resource setting <TT>tearOffModel</TT> should be set to <TT>TEAR_OFF_ENABLED</TT>
in the <A HREF="BEnvironment.html#Environment!XBMotif">XBMotif</A> resource
file).

<H2><A NAME="Help">On-line Help</A></H2>
Extensive on-line help information is available through the <TT>Help</TT>
menu, which displays a list of subjects. Selecting a subject calls up an
editor window to display the corresponding text.

<P>Other on-line help can be obtained by clicking with the mouse on many
of the entities on the main panel. (Try clicking, for instance, on the
environment name.)
