<H1><A NAME="Translator">The Translator (trl)</A></H1>

The Translator (trl) is invoked from the 
<A HREF="BToolkit.html#Environments!Translators">Translators Environment</A> 
and
is applicable to all 
<A HREF="AMNotation.html#IMPLEMENTATION">implementations</A> 
which are currently 
<A HREF="Analyser.html#Analyser">analysed</A>, 
but not translated.
<P>
The C-compiler is set through the 
<A HREF="Options.html#Options!C_Compiler_Flags">C Compiler/Flags</A>
setting of the
<A HREF="Options.html#Options">Options</A>;
for example:
<PRE>
    gcc -g
</PRE>
would result in code produced by the gcc compiler with the debugging
option set.
<P>
The setting of the 
<A HREF="Options.html#Options!Programming_Language">Programming Language Option</A> 
determines whether (currently) C or ANSI-C is produced as the
intermediate language.
<P>
The Translator translates an 
<A HREF="AMNotation.html#IMPLEMENTATION">IMPLEMENTATION</A> 
into an executable code
module; a prerequisite for translation is that the implementation and
all subordinate implementations are 
<A HREF="Analyser.html#Analyser">analysed</A>; 
the C Compiler is used
to generate the executable binary for the machine on which the
B-Toolkit is running. Subordinate implementations that are analysed but
not yet translated are translated first.
<P>
If the specification `spec.mch' is implemented by `prog.imp', then
translation of the latter will produce the files `spec.g',`spec.h',
`spec.c' and `spec.o' all written to the 
<A HREF="BToolkit.html#Development_Environment">CDE/C</A> 
directory.`spec.o' is
the binary linkable code module, `spec.h' contains header information
for an 
<A HREF="AMNotation.html#IMPLEMENTATION">IMPLEMENTATION</A> 
which 
<A HREF="Structuring.html#IMPORTS_Clause!Using">IMPORTS</A> 
or 
<A HREF="Structuring.html#SEES_Clause!Using">SEES</A> 
`spec.mch', and `spec.g'
contains module parameterisation information to be used at 
<A HREF="Linker.html#Linker">link-time</A>
when the values of module parameters are known.
<P>
Note that, an 
<A HREF="AMNotation.html#IMPLEMENTATION">IMPLEMENTATION</A> 
has no variables of its own which are
global to all operations (e.g. the VARIABLES clause is not allowed).
All static data (information global to the module) or persistent data
(information which survives from one invocation of the module to the
next) must be held within other machines which the implementation
<A HREF="Structuring.html#IMPORTS_Clause!Using">IMPORTS</A>. 
In the B-Toolkit environment there is a selection of such
pre-defined machines.
<P>
The pre-defined machines are held in the 
<A HREF="SystemLibrary.html#System_Library">System Library</A> 
and can be
introduced into a development by using the 
<A HREF="Introduce.html#Introduce">`Introduce construct from SLIB'</A>
facility.

<H2>The `main' Implementation:</H2>

    The machine/implementation which contains the single operation
    `main' will be the main module of the development. This module
    will be the top node when all executable object modules are
    <A HREF="Linker.html#Linker">linked</A>,
    and the main operation will be the entry when the linked
    code is invoked.

<H2>The Translation Process</H2>

The Translator translates the following clauses of an IMPLEMENTATION:
<UL>
<LI> The MACHINE header clause:

    <P>The Translator provides for an implementation of the formal
    machine parameters. 
    Linking information is generated from this clause.

<LI> The <A HREF="Structuring.html#IMPORTS_Clause!Using">IMPORTS</A> clause:

    <P>The Translator provides for an implementation which makes 
    instances of the imported MACHINEs known to this implementation;
    an imported MACHINE must be a library (<A HREF="SystemLibrary.html#System_Library">SLIB</A> machine),
    a generated machine (with code module, for example generated
    through the Enumerator) or a MACHINE which already has been
    provided with an IMPLEMENTATION within the development.
    Linking information is generated from this clause.

<LI> The <A HREF="Structuring.html#SEES_Clause!Using">SEES</A> clause:

    <P>The Translator provides for an implementation which makes seen
    MACHINEs known to the implementation. A seen MACHINE must be a
    committed construct which is imported elsewhere, in which
    case its state is shared between the machine which imports it
    and the machine which sees it.

<LI> The  <A HREF="AMNotation.html#CONSTANTS_Clause">CONSTANTS</A> and <A HREF="AMNotation.html#PROPERTIES_Clause">PROPERTIES</A> clauses:

    <P>All constants must be given an exact value in the <A HREF="AMNotation.html#PROPERTIES_Clause">PROPERTIES</A> clause.
    The constants and its values are known to all implementation which
    <A HREF="Structuring.html#SEES_Clause!Using">SEES</A> or <A HREF="Structuring.html#IMPORTS_Clause!Using">IMPORTS</A> the MACHINE for which we are providing an
    implementation.
    Header information is generated from this clause.

<LI> The <A HREF="AMNotation.html#SETS_Clause">SETS</A> and <A HREF="AMNotation.html#PROPERTIES_Clause">PROPERTIES</A> clauses:

    <P>The Translator provides for an implementation of enumerated sets and
    deferred sets.  The deferred sets must be given an exact value within
    the latter clause; however, the value is normally a deferred set from
    an imported machine.
    Header information is generated from this clause.

<LI> The <A HREF="AMNotation.html#INITIALISATION_Clause">INITIALISATION</A> clause:

    <P>The Translator provides for a C implementation of the initialisation
    which is executed at run-time on invocation. Note that the INITIALISATION
    clauses of all imported MACHINES are automatically invoked before any
    statements present in this clause.

<LI> The <A HREF="AMNotation.html#OPERATIONS_Clause">OPERATIONS</A> clause:

    <P>Each of the operations is translated into code. Note that for imported
    <A HREF="SystemLibrary.html#System_Library">SLIB</A> MACHINES,
    operations are translated into parameterised macros and others
    into C functions or procedures.

</UL>

<H2>Note:</H2>
<UL><LI>
  The `file_dump' machine must always be imported into the development
  when the development uses a state machine from the System Library,
  even if the dump facilities SAVE and RESTORE from the state machine
  are not actually used.
</UL>
